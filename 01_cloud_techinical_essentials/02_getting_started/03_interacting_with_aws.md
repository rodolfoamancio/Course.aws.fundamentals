# Interacting with AWS

AWS API stand for Application programming interface, used to logically interact with the infrastructure. The different ways to interact are:
1. The AWS management console,
2. The AWS command line interface (CLI),
3. The AWS software development kits (SDK).

The console is the easier to use format, allowing for the interaction by a web interface.

The CLI interface can be accessed in two ways: first, by downloading the CLI application; second, by using AWS cloud shell.

Finally, SDK can integrate AWS directly with the software development.
