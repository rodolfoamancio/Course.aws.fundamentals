## Storage

Data and apps in AWS are storage are stored in data centers around the world, each of those with redundancies. These data clusters are called Availability Zones (`AZ`). A cluster of connected AZs is called a region.

## How to choose a region?
The answer usually involves 4 key aspects:
1. Compliance: associated with IT rules, and norm on where or how to store the data.
2. Latency: how close the region is close to the users.
3. Pricing: changes from region to region due to tax regulations.
4. Service availability: what services are available and are needed.
