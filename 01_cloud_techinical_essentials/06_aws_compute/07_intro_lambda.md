# AWS Lambda

`Lambda` is a serverless solution which allows for the storage of the code application, which generates a lambda function. This lambda function does not run continuously, rather being initialized by triggers, which can be HTTP requests, other apps signals etc. 

When the code is executed, it runs on an isolated environment, managed by Lambda.

Pros:
- automatically scalable, 
- highly available,
- all maintenance of the environment itself is done by AWS
