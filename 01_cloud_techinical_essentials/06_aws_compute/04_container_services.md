# Container services on AWS

Container orchestration services:
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (`ECS`)
- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (`EKS`)

In order to use containers, it is necessary to run processes to: start, stop, restart, monitor *etc* the containers. This is called **Container Orchestration**.
