## Breaking Up Applications and Databases

As the industry changes, applications and databases change too. Today, with larger applications, you no longer see just one database supporting it. Instead, these applications are being broken into smaller services, each with their own purpose-built database supporting it.

This shift removes the idea of a one-size-fits-all database and replaces it with a complimentary database strategy. You can give each database the appropriate functionality, performance, and scale that the workload requires.
