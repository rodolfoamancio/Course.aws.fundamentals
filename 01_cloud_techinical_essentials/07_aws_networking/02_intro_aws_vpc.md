# Intro to VPC

VPC is equivalent to a wall in a building, it establishes a boundary between application and other environments, with fixed rules for information transfer. 

To create a VPC it is necessary to set:
1. Region,
2. IP range.

Inside the VPC it is possible to create *subnets*, each with different controls and settings.

In the VPC configuration it is also possible to configure the internet gateway for the app's communication.
